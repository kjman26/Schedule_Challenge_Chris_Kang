Purpose:
    The purpose of this project is to create a daily planner that allows the user to create an efficient schedule amidst the hecticness of life.

Functionality/Use:
    The user is able to create a daily schedule with ease based on the time during traditional working hours (9a-5p).
    It is color coded to indicate whether the time slot is currently full, in the past, or open and indicated by red, yellow, or green.


What I learned:
    Classes are crucial! Proper syntax is a must and the tiniest of errors will lead to failure.
